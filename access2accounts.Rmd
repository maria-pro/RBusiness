#Financial statements and accounting data

Working with accounting starts with getting access to accounting data.

While some paid access is available for accounting data, we are interested in working with free resources at this stage and the blessing comes from a requirement for `public` companies to have their data freely available, though in a "messy" form.

Common issues here:

- data is available as annual reports in various formats, such as pdf, docx, etc

- data comes in various structures - in most cases the format for accounting statements are not fixed to allow companies to communicate `true and fair` presentation of accounts

- country-specific data repositories, e.g. `EDGAR` in US and `Company House` in UK

- country-specific requirements for preparation of accounts, e.g. `IFRS` (International Financial Reporting Standards) and `US GAAP` (General Accepted Accounting Principles).

We are going to work with US accounting data at this stage and [EDGAR](https://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml)
